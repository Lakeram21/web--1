        <div class="white_space_info">
            <p><b>White Space</b>- Amazon's webpage has a lot of items
                and a lot of information. However becausse of their use of
                white space, their page is attractive, readble. They do a great
                job by placing space between items and items information so that a customer
                is aware which information belongs to which item. <b>White space</b> is the blank
                area around, inside, or between the elements of a design. It’s not the star of the show, but
                great design cannot exist without it.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="repetition_info">
            <p> <b>Contrast</b> is designing a distinct difference between
                foreground and background colors in order to enhance
                readability. Walmart is a great example of this.
                A customer can easly read, naviagate and search for items
                on their website becasue the background color makes the fonts higly readable.</p>

            <p><b>Fitts Law</b>- On this page a user is able to navigate and get to their
                desired locatio/information because it is not crowded with information
                This page has a JOIN button which is big enough to draw a viewer into what needs to be done,
                in the least amount of time. And this is exactly what Fitts law is.</p>
